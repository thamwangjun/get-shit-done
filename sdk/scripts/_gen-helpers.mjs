/**
 * Shared helpers for gen-*.mjs generator scripts.
 *
 * Provides requireFreshDist(), a pre-generation guard that verifies the
 * compiled sdk/dist artifact is newer than its TypeScript source. If the
 * dist file is missing or stale, the function exits 1 with a clear,
 * actionable error message so the developer knows to run `npm run build:sdk`.
 *
 * Single source of truth — import from here rather than duplicating the mtime
 * logic in each generator.
 *
 * @example
 *   import { requireFreshDist } from './_gen-helpers.mjs';
 *   requireFreshDist('sdk/dist/query/secrets.js', 'sdk/src/query/secrets.ts');

/**
 * Assert that a compiled dist file is at least as new as its TypeScript source.
 *
 * Design notes:
 *   - Single Responsibility: each generator is responsible for verifying its
 *     own preconditions before touching dist. This keeps the guard co-located
 *     with the code that depends on it.
 *   - Composability: callers that have already built can call generators
 *     directly; the guard is a cheap mtime check, not a rebuild trigger.
 *   - Debuggability: the error message names both paths and both mtimes so the
 *     developer can see at a glance what is stale and what to do about it.
 *   - Performance: two synchronous statSync calls — effectively zero cost
 *     relative to the import/transform work the generator does next.
 *
 * NOT auto-building: auto-building inside the generator couples it to the
 * build toolchain, bloats its dependency graph, and removes composability —
 * a caller that already built cannot skip the redundant rebuild. The guard
 * pattern is the correct separation: tell the developer what to do, not do it
 * for them.
